        <h2>Pose</h2>
        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Your pose, or body position, will determine how fast, how long, and/or how painful your run is going to be. The better position you put yourself in from the start of your run, and maintain it throughout your run, the faster, longer, and less painful your run will be at the end. Putting your body in the right position starts with your spinal position. Everything starts and ends with your backbone. Without that foundation, any movement in any other part of your body will not be as efficient and optimal.</p>
